        <h1>Hey I'm Yukun</h1>


        <h3>Software Engineer && Media Planner</h3>

        <p>I am fascinated by how computer science has brought changes to our lives that could never have been predicted; 
            witnessing the expansion of computer technology allowed me to think to be a software engineering to make human lives easier, 
            and my enthusiasm has perpetually developed since this time.
